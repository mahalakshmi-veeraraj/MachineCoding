HTTP - stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
HTTP is a mechanism which is used for communication between client such as web browsers, and servers.
It must have some set of rules for how messages should be transmitted and formatted.
Header - Meta data of a request.
Methods:
1. GET - via which we get data from server.
2. POST - via which we send data to server.
3. PUT - when we want to displace the entire object. 
4. PATCH - when we want to replace a single key value pair.
5. DELETE - delete data stored on server.
6. CONNECT - establishes a connection tunnel to server.
Status Code: basically let us know the status of our request made.
1. 1XX - 100, 101, 102 .... 199 - Information Responses 
2. 2XX - 200, 201, 202 .... 299 - Successful Responses
3. 3XX - 300, 301, 302 .... 399 - Redirection Responses
4. 4XX - 400, 401, 402 .... 499 - Client error responses
5. 5XX - 500, 501, 502 .... 599 - Server error responses

HTTP is stateless. What it means?
Stateless means each request from client to server is independent.
If I get the category list data, and if I again hit the get request to get the same category list data 
then will get a new result only it will not remember the old value and return that as result.
Every HTTP request is getting served freshly everytime.
This is waht meant by stateless.
