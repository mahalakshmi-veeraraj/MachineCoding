<!-- Problem Description:
Implement a Throttle Function in JavaScript

In this coding challenge, you will practice implementing a throttle function in JavaScript. 
After you've learnt about throttling, this exercise will give you hands-on experience in 
creating a functional throttle utility.

Instructions:
You are provided with a partially completed function named throttle. 
Your task is to complete the implementation to create a functional throttle utility.
The throttle function should take two arguments: 
fn (the function to be throttled) and time (the time interval in milliseconds).
Test your throttle function with different time intervals and functions.

Important Pointers:
Throttling is useful in scenarios where you want to limit the frequency of a function's execution 
to a specified time interval.
Be sure to capture the function's context (this) and arguments inside the inner function.
Experiment with different functions and time intervals to see how the throttle function behaves.

Function Signature and Test Case:
function throttle(fn, time) {
}
// Test Cases

const throttledFunc = throttle((value) => console.log(value), 200);

throttledFunc("First call"); // Should log
throttledFunc("Second call"); // Should not log -->
<!-- Throttling: Limit the number of API calls.  -->

    <!-- WARNING:
        Don't make any changes outside the given function. (would fail test cases)
        Write the required code and return the correct answer. -->

        // complete the throttle function given below
