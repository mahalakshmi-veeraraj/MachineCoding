<!-- Problem Description:
Implement a Debounce Function in JavaScript

In this problem, you will solidify your understanding of debouncing by creating your own debounce function in JavaScript. After learning about debouncing, this hands-on challenge will help you apply the concept and develop a functional debounce utility.

Instructions:
You are provided with a partially completed function named debounce. Your task is to complete the implementation to create a working debounce utility.
The debounce function should take two arguments: func (the function to be debounced) and wait (the time interval in milliseconds).
Test your debounce function with various scenarios, including different debounce intervals and functions.
Important pointers:
Remember that debouncing is useful in scenarios where you want to delay the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed without additional calls.
To test your implementation, create a test function that logs a message to the console. Use your debounce function to debounce the test function and observe the behavior.
Function Signature and Test Case:

function debounce(func, wait) {
}

// Test Cases

const debouncedFunc = debounce((value) => console.log(value), 200);

debouncedFunc("First call"); // Should not log immediately
debouncedFunc("Second call"); // Should cancel the previous and set a new timeout
// Wait for 200 ms
// Should log "Second call" after 200 ms -->

        Don't make any changes outside the given function. (would fail test cases)
